# New Filament Procedure



##	
	### Summary

	A simple test for parts fitting. If the printer is properly set, the two parts should perfectly click together, like two Lego blocks.

	You should repeat prints while adjusting Extrusion Multiplier or Filament Flow Live Tuning (depending on your software and printer), until the two parts snugly fit together. The XY Size Compensation should not be used if extrusion is properly set!

	The process should be done for each new roll of filament.

	Unlike the original object, this one has a lower base to increase printing speed and a groove on the top of both parts to mark the proper orientation.
	
	NOTE
	The layering effect affects the resulting inner and outer dimensions of printed objects. It can be more or less pronounced on your printer and settings, so your mileage may vary.
	It also depends on your exact filament diameter and its consistency, so on a properly calibrated printer with a quality filament, the resulting extrusion multiplier will always be a few percents lower than 100%. Therefore, this is more of a "part fitting" rather than "exact extrusion" calibration (see https://mattshub.com/2017/04/19/extruder-calibration/ for the extruder steps calibration).
	Calibration Process

	    Print the objects. Wait until it cools down before removing from the print-bed.
	    Try to plug one object into the other. Be careful, the orientation does matter!
	    a) If the objects can't fit, lower the Extrusion Multiplier or Flow and repeat.
	    b) If the objects fit too loosely, increase the Extrusion Multiplier or Flow and repeat.
	    c) If the two fit snugly (you can easily snap them together, and disconnect without breaking your nails), you're fine - the calibration is done!

	#### Example:

	    Start with EM value of 1.0. Slice and print the two parts.
	    If the parts can not fit, decrease to 0.9.
	    If they still can not fit, decrease to 0.8.
	    Now your parts are too loose. Now use 0.85 (which is half the way between 0.8 and 0.9)
	    If the fit is still too loose, use value 0.875 (which is half the way between 0.85 and 0.9)
	    If the fit is now too tight, use value 0.863 (which is half the way between 0.85 and 0.875)
	    This value should be fine. It should be enough to round EM value to 3 decimals.
