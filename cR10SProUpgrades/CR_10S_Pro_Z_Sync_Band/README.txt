# Summary

My Simple Dual Z Sync Mod

My Simple Dual Z Sync Mod simply keeps both Z axis lead screws in sync, removing the need to sync them each time you power off or bump your Creality CR-10S Pro. There is no loss of Z axis height with this minimalist mod and no need to print any parts.

Back to our regularly scheduled modification.. ;)

Required:

Two 20T GT2 Pulleys (Width: 6 Bore: 8)
One 760mm GT2 380T Timing Belt

Optional:

A drill and drill bit

Simply remove the two screws on top of each of the stock Z bearing retaining blocks and remove the retaining cover. The only purpose of this cover is to hold the bearing in place.

Place one of the GT2 Pulleys on the top of each lead screw. Lightly tighten. This will retain the bearing.

Place the GT2 Belt over both of the pulleys. You may need to loosen the four screws that hold the bearing retaining blocks to the 2020 rail and slide them to the outside of the printer by a millimeter if you need to add tension to your belt.

Optionally, you can drill a small hole in the back of the bearing retaining block to give you direct access to adjust the pulley grub screws.

Loosen both grub screws on one of the GT2 Pulleys and adjust your printer using the Z leveling shim supplied (or better yet, print a couple "Z leveling blocks" from Thingiverse. Once you get it level, tighten the grub screws in both of the pulleys and you are done.

Run your Aux leveling and ABL routines and have fun focusing on your prints instead of trying to keep the Z axis in sync.
