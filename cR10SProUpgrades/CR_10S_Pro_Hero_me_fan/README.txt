# Summary

Full build guid [here](https://www.buildxyz.xyz/creality-cr-10s-pro-hero-me-build-guide/)

This mod uses all the original CR10S-Pro parts BUT can easily accommodate other sensors and fan configurations through its modular design. The original [Hero Me CR10S-Pro](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433619) has also been updated with the specs now so they are the same!

This a remix/grouping of items for my build with a provided guide. I have slightly modified the clearances on the Hero Me base and added holes to access the hotend mounting bolts. I have also made adjustments to the inductive probe mount as the mounting hole needed to enlarged for my stock probe.
